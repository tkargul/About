Hi,I am a researcher from Poland. I am working as assistant professor at the University of Science and Technology AGH in Kraków, and the mainstream of my research is focused on thermal analysis. In my research, I use the DSC method to determine the thermal properties of steel and other materials that change under the influence of temperature. I am working in laboratory with NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter (furnace with with upper temperature limit 1600C). I also have some programming skills. I write programs in C, C++ and Delphi.I write programs that allow me to model real processes based on thermodynamic foundamentals.
I also conduct classes with computer science students on the basics of programming in C and C++.
