Hi,I am a researcher from Poland. I am working as assistant professor at the University of Science and Technology AGH in KrakÃ³w, and the mainstream of my research is focused on thermal analysis. I use DSC as the main method to analyse such thermal properties such as specific heat, enthalpy or temperatures of phase transitio. I am working in laboratory with NETZSCH STA 449 F3 Jupiter (furnace with with upper temperature limit 1600C). I also have some programming skills. I write programs in C, C++ and delphi.
